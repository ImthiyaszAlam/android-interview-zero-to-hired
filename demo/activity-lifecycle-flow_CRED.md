## üß† Mindmap Format ‚Äì Android Interview Q\&A #6

### **Interview Question**

What are the different states in an Android Activity lifecycle, and how do they affect API calls or UI updates?

üè¢ **Asked in:**

## üß© The Problem Most Juniors Face

They memorize this:

> `onCreate() ‚Üí onStart() ‚Üí onResume() ‚Üí onPause() ‚Üí onStop() ‚Üí onDestroy()`

But they *can‚Äôt explain*:

* Where to start an API call?
* When to stop a video?
* Why a crash happens when screen rotates?

Let‚Äôs fix that.

### ‚è∫Ô∏è Lifecycle Categories:

* **Active state:** `onResume()` ‚Äì user is seeing and interacting with the screen.
* **Visible but inactive:** `onStart()` ‚Äì visible, but user not interacting.
* **Hidden/in background:** `onStop()` ‚Äì user left or opened another app.
* **Destroyed:** `onDestroy()` ‚Äì Activity is cleaned up.

## ‚úÖ Where to Do What (Real-Life Mappings)

| Task                          | Best Lifecycle Method       | Why?                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Setup UI, init views          | `onCreate()`                | One-time setup                   |
| Start animations, videos      | `onResume()`                | User is interacting              |
| Fetch fresh API data          | `onStart()` or `onResume()` | App is visible again             |
| Pause videos, unregisters     | `onPause()`                 | Stop heavy operations            |
| Release resources, stop tasks | `onStop()` or `onDestroy()` | App is leaving screen or closing |

---

## üö´ What Juniors Do Wrong

* API call in `onCreate()` ‚Üí Result arrives after rotation ‚Üí app crashes or leaks.
* Forgetting to unregister location or broadcast receivers ‚Üí battery drain.
* Updating UI in `onStop()` ‚Üí app crashes with `IllegalStateException`.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Say It in Interview

> ‚ÄúI use `onCreate()` for one-time setups like binding views or initializing ViewModels.
>
> I avoid doing network calls there. Instead, I trigger data loading in `onStart()` or `onResume()`, depending on if the screen needs refresh.
>
> I stop listeners and animations in `onPause()` and `onStop()` to avoid leaks and wasted resources.‚Äù

---

## üß™ Where This Goes Wrong in Real Apps

* **Video continues playing in background** because dev forgot to pause in `onPause()`.
* **Multiple API calls fired** on each screen rotation because data was fetched in `onCreate()`.
* **Location services kept running** even after app was closed ‚Äî major battery drain.

---

## üéØ Pro Tips (Senior Level Insight)

* Use `repeatOnLifecycle()` (from lifecycle-runtime-ktx) to **launch coroutines safely**:

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
        viewModel.uiState.collect { updateUI(it) }
    }
}
```

* Don‚Äôt put coroutines directly in `onCreate()` or `onResume()` without scoping.
* In Compose, use `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` with `LifecycleOwner.lifecycle` if needed.

## üìå Interview Checklist

| Question                           | Your Thinking Should Be‚Ä¶                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Where do I call APIs?              | `onStart()` or `onResume()`                 |
| When do I clean up resources?      | `onPause()` / `onStop()` / `onDestroy()`    |
| Why not call APIs in `onCreate()`? | Risk of double-fetch during rotation        |
| What if Activity gets destroyed?   | Data should live in ViewModel, not Activity |

---

## ‚è© TL;DR ‚Äì 1-Min Summary

* Lifecycle is not just a list ‚Äî it's a behavior contract.
* Start heavy work **only when user is seeing screen**.
* Avoid leaks by stopping services/listeners early.
* Use ViewModel + lifecycleScope + repeatOnLifecycle for modern architecture.
* Think like Android: user-visible = do work; not visible = pause/cleanup.
