# Interview Question  
**What are the different states in an Android Activity lifecycle, and how do they affect API calls or UI updates?**

**Company:** Cred  
**Role:** Android Developer  
**Experience:** 1.5+ years

---

## The Problem Most Juniors Face  
They memorize this:

`onCreate() → onStart() → onResume() → onPause() → onStop() → onDestroy()`

But they can’t explain:

- Where to start an API call?  
- When to stop a video?  
- Why a crash happens when screen rotates?

---

## Flow-Based Understanding – The Lifecycle Stream  

```

App Opens:
┌────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ onCreate() │ ───▶ │ onStart()   │ ───▶ │ onResume()  │
└────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
▼
\[User interacts here]
▼
┌────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│ onPause()  │ ◀─── │ onStop()    │ ◀─── │ onDestroy()   │
└────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └──────────────┘

## Lifecycle Categories  

- **Active state:** `onResume()` – user is seeing and interacting with the screen  
- **Visible but inactive:** `onStart()` – visible, but user not interacting  
- **Hidden/in background:** `onStop()` – user left or opened another app  
- **Destroyed:** `onDestroy()` – Activity is cleaned up

## Where to Do What (Real-Life Mappings)  

| Task                          | Best Lifecycle Method       | Why?                             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Setup UI, init views         | `onCreate()`                | One-time setup                   |
| Start animations, videos     | `onResume()`                | User is interacting              |
| Fetch fresh API data         | `onStart()` or `onResume()` | App is visible again             |
| Pause videos, unregisters    | `onPause()`                 | Stop heavy operations            |
| Release resources, stop tasks| `onStop()` or `onDestroy()` | App is leaving screen or closing |

---

## What Juniors Do Wrong  

- API call in `onCreate()` → Result arrives after rotation → app crashes or leaks  
- Forgetting to unregister location or broadcast receivers → battery drain  
- Updating UI in `onStop()` → app crashes with `IllegalStateException`  

---

## How to Say It in Interview  

“I use `onCreate()` for one-time setups like binding views or initializing ViewModels.

I avoid doing network calls there. Instead, I trigger data loading in `onStart()` or `onResume()`, depending on if the screen needs refresh.

I stop listeners and animations in `onPause()` and `onStop()` to avoid leaks and wasted resources.”

---

## Where This Goes Wrong in Real Apps  

- Video continues playing in background because dev forgot to pause in `onPause()`  
- Multiple API calls fired on each screen rotation because data was fetched in `onCreate()`  
- Location services kept running even after app was closed — major battery drain  

---

## Pro Tips (Senior Level Insight)  

Use `repeatOnLifecycle()` (from lifecycle-runtime-ktx) to launch coroutines safely:

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
        viewModel.uiState.collect { updateUI(it) }
    }
}
````

* Don’t put coroutines directly in `onCreate()` or `onResume()` without scoping
* In Compose, use `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` with `LifecycleOwner.lifecycle` if needed

## Interview Checklist

| Question                           | Your Thinking Should Be…                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Where do I call APIs?              | `onStart()` or `onResume()`                 |
| When do I clean up resources?      | `onPause()` / `onStop()` / `onDestroy()`    |
| Why not call APIs in `onCreate()`? | Risk of double-fetch during rotation        |
| What if Activity gets destroyed?   | Data should live in ViewModel, not Activity |

---

## TL;DR – 1-Min Summary

* Lifecycle is not just a list — it's a behavior contract
* Start heavy work only when user is seeing the screen
* Avoid leaks by stopping services/listeners early
* Use ViewModel + lifecycleScope + repeatOnLifecycle for modern architecture
* Think like Android: user-visible = do work; not visible = pause/cleanup
