# Interview Question  
**Why does RecyclerView lag even after using DiffUtil? How can you fix it?**

**Company:** Flipkart  
**Role:** Android Engineer  
**Experience:** 2.0 years

## Simplified Answer

Even with `DiffUtil`, your RecyclerView can lag if:

- You're inflating heavy layouts  
- You're loading too much data at once  
- You forgot to use `ListAdapter`  
- Your `onBindViewHolder()` does extra work  

`DiffUtil` is great ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not magic.

## Explain Like I‚Äôm 5

- **RecyclerView** = A list that reuses item views to save memory  
- **DiffUtil** = A smart helper that updates only what changed in the list  
- **Lag** = When your scrolling feels slow or stutters  

If you write heavy or messy code, `DiffUtil` can‚Äôt save you.

## Common Mistake by Candidates

> ‚ÄúI used `DiffUtil`, so performance should be fine.‚Äù

Wrong.

You still need:

- Efficient `onBindViewHolder()`  
- Lightweight layouts  
- Async image loading  
- Paging for large datasets

## How to Answer in Interview

"RecyclerView can lag if item views are complex, or too much work is done during binding.  

Even if I use `DiffUtil`, if I'm doing work like image decoding or calculations inside `onBindViewHolder()`, it causes frame drops.

To fix this, I:

- Use `ListAdapter` with DiffUtil  
- Load images using Glide or Coil  
- Simplify item layouts  
- Avoid nesting views deeply  
- Use Paging3 for large lists"

## Before vs After ‚Äì Code Example

### ‚ùå Laggy Code (Heavy Work on Main Thread)

```kotlin
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: MyViewHolder, position: Int) {
    val item = list[position]
    holder.title.text = item.title
    holder.image.setImageBitmap(getBitmap(item.url)) // üî¥ heavy work
}
````

### ‚úÖ Optimized Code

```kotlin
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: MyViewHolder, position: Int) {
    val item = getItem(position)
    holder.title.text = item.title
    Glide.with(holder.image).load(item.url).into(holder.image)
}
```

## Where This Goes Wrong in Real Projects

A developer loads 100+ items with images in a single API response.
They manually load images and do no recycling optimizations.

Result?

* RecyclerView scrolls with lag
* App drops frames
* Poor UX, crashes on low-end phones

Fix: Use Paging3 + Glide + `ListAdapter`.

---

## Red Flag Words to Avoid

* ‚ÄúI use DiffUtil, so it should be fast.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI just call `notifyDataSetChanged()`.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use any image library.‚Äù

---

## Pro Tip

Avoid calling `notifyDataSetChanged()` ‚Äî it bypasses `DiffUtil`, rebinds every item, and destroys scroll performance.

Use:

* `submitList()` for `ListAdapter`
* `notifyItemChanged()` for specific items

## Cheatsheet ‚Äì Quick Fix Table

| Problem          | Fix                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Scroll lag       | Light layouts + clean binding   |
| List flickers    | Use `ListAdapter` with DiffUtil |
| Image load delay | Use Glide/Coil with caching     |
| Memory overload  | Use Paging3 for large datasets  |

## If You Don't Know This in Interview

Say:

> "I know DiffUtil helps reduce work, but scrolling can still lag if I write heavy bind logic. I‚Äôd also optimize layout, image loading, and list size."

This shows you're aware of real-world performance factors.

---

## TL;DR ‚Äì 1-Min Summary

* DiffUtil helps detect changes, but won‚Äôt fix lag from poor code
* Avoid doing heavy work inside `onBindViewHolder()`
* Use Glide or Coil for image loading
* Use Paging3 for large datasets
* Avoid `notifyDataSetChanged()` ‚Äî it's a performance killer
