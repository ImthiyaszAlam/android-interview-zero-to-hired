-  No Theory. No Udemy Slides.

## 📌 Why This Exists

I’m not a FAANG dev, and I don’t work at Google. I’m an Android engineer from a small startup — just like you. But over the last year, I’ve personally spoken to over **300 Android developers** from top product-based companies like **Swiggy, Flipkart, Meesho, Dream11, Zomato**, and more. I asked them about their real interview experiences — the **actual questions** they were asked, the **mistakes** they made, and the **answers** that helped them crack those roles.

This repo is a result of those raw, honest conversations — not recycled theory, not generic ChatGPT fluff. Just **real-world, battle-tested interview prep** that will get you hired.
