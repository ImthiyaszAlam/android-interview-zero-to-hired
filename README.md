##  Why This Exists

I’m not a FAANG dev. I don’t work at Google.
I’m an Android engineer from a startup — just like you.

But over the last year, I’ve spoken to **300+ Android developers** from top product-based companies like **Swiggy, Flipkart, Meesho, Dream11, Zomato** and more.

I collected their **real interview experiences**, the **exact questions** they were asked, the **mistakes** they made, and the **answers** that helped them get hired.

This repo is built from those conversations — not theory, not ChatGPT fluff.
